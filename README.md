An AI virtual mouse in Python is a program that allows users to control the computer cursor without physical hardware. Using OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand tracking, the virtual mouse detects hand gestures and movements via a webcam. Specific gestures like moving fingers can be mapped to mouse actions such as cursor movement, clicks, and drags, effectively simulating a mouse. This project combines computer vision and hand tracking to create a touch-free, intuitive control experience and is ideal for interactive, hands-free applications.
